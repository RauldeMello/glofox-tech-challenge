# Task 2 - Complete the form! - 45min

Setup the environment together with the team member.
```
npm installhttps://github.com/RauldeMello/glofox-tech-challenge/blob/main/README.md
npm start
```

Goal:
```
Adapt the project to your own vision, shine!!
Feel free to delete, edit, move around anything.
```

This task is not intended to be completed, so no need to rush through it.

Considerations

- Input for a trainer field
    Data input has to be fetched from the API defined as `STAFF_ENDPOINT`

- Basic validations are contained in the config const

- Submit data to the API defined as `APPOINTMENT_ENDPOINT`

- Style the inputs!!, free to add whatever you think it looks good in a consistent reusable way.
